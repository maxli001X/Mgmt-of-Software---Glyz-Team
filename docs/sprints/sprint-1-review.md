- **Documentation:** CONTRIBUTING.md created with workflow guidelines

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Project Foundation
- âœ… Django 5.2 project initialized
- âœ… Project structure: `treehole/` (config), `templates/`, `static/`
- âœ… Apps created: `posting/`, `auth_landing/`
- âœ… Virtual environment configured
- âœ… Requirements.txt with initial dependencies

### 2. Database Models
- âœ… Post model (title, body, author, created_at, is_anonymous)
- âœ… Tag model (name, slug)
- âœ… Initial migrations created
- âœ… SQLite database configured for development

### 3. Design System

- âœ… CSS structure (`static/css/styles.css`)
- âœ… Yale blue color scheme established
- âœ… Responsive navigation structure
- âœ… Mobile-first CSS approach

### 4. Development Workflow

- âœ… Git workflow documented
- âœ… Issue templates created
- âœ… Project structure documented in README

### 5. Initial UI

## Metrics
- **Velocity:** 24 points (Setup sprint - not counted in feature velocity)
- **Team Capacity:** All 4 team members active
- **Code Quality:** Initial structure follows Django best practices
- **Documentation:** Core documentation in place

## What Was Learned
1. **Django Project Structure:** Established clear separation between project config and apps
2. **Team Collaboration:** Feature-based organization prevents merge conflicts
3. **Design System:** Early establishment of CSS structure pays off later
4. **Planning:** Good foundation makes feature development faster

## Unfinished Work
- None (all planned setup tasks completed)

## Next Steps
- Sprint 2 planning: Focus on authentication and basic posting features
- Begin user story estimation for Sprint 2
- Set up issue tracking for Sprint 2 backlog

## Stakeholder Feedback
- Project structure looks solid
- Ready to begin feature development in Sprint 2
- Team workflow established and documented
