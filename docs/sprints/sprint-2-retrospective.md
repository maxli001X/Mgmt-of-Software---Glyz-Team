- **Form Handling:** Django forms worked well for validation
- **Template System:** Consistent use of templates across features
- **Database Design:** Models designed well with proper relationships

### 5. Process
- **Sprint Planning:** Good story breakdown and estimation
- **Daily Standups:** Regular communication helped identify blockers early
- **Definition of Done:** Clear criteria helped ensure quality
- **Velocity Tracking:** Established baseline velocity of 45 points

## What Could Be Improved 🔄

### 1. Performance Optimization
- **Issue:** Some queries could be optimized (N+1 query problems)
- **Impact:** Feed view could be slow with many posts
- **Action:** Use select_related and prefetch_related in Sprint 3

### 2. UI/UX Polish
- **Issue:** Basic UI works but could be more polished
- **Impact:** User experience is functional but not exceptional
- **Action:** Add UI improvements in future sprints

### 3. Error Handling
- **Issue:** Some error messages could be more user-friendly
- **Impact:** Users may not understand what went wrong
- **Action:** Improve error messaging in Sprint 3

### 4. Documentation
- **Issue:** Some code lacks inline documentation
- **Impact:** Future maintenance may be harder
- **Action:** Add docstrings to views and models

### 5. Integration Testing
- **Issue:** Mostly unit tests, fewer integration tests
- **Impact:** May miss issues with complete user flows
- **Action:** Add integration tests for key user journeys

## Action Items for Sprint 3

### High Priority
1. ✅ **Query Optimization** - Use select_related/prefetch_related to prevent N+1 queries
2. ✅ **Profile System** - Implement user profiles and settings
3. ✅ **Enhanced Posting** - Add voting, search functionality
4. ✅ **UI Improvements** - Polish existing UI elements

### Medium Priority
1. ✅ **Integration Tests** - Add tests for complete user flows
2. ✅ **Error Handling** - Improve user-facing error messages
3. ✅ **Code Documentation** - Add docstrings to key functions
4. ✅ **Performance Monitoring** - Add Django Debug Toolbar

### Low Priority
1. ✅ **Accessibility** - Improve ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
2. ✅ **Mobile Optimization** - Enhance mobile experience
3. ✅ **Analytics** - Consider adding basic analytics

## Key Learnings

### Technical
1. **Django Authentication:** Using Django's built-in auth saves significant time
2. **ManyToMany Relationships:** Tags work well with ManyToMany, but need careful querying
3. **Form Validation:** Both client-side and server-side validation are important
4. **Test-Driven Development:** Writing tests early catches bugs before they reach production
5. **Database Indexes:** Need to add indexes for frequently queried fields

### Process
1. **Story Estimation:** 45 points was accurate for team capacity
2. **Feature-Based Organization:** Prevents merge conflicts effectively
3. **Code Reviews:** Helpful for catching bugs and sharing knowledge
4. **Velocity Tracking:** Important for future sprint planning

### Team
1. **Parallel Development:** Feature-based structure enables simultaneous work
2. **Knowledge Sharing:** Team members learning Django together accelerated progress
3. **Communication:** Regular check-ins prevented blockers
4. **Ownership:** Clear ownership of features reduced confusion

## Metrics & Velocity

- **Sprint 2 Velocity:** 45 points
- **Team Capacity:** 4 developers
- **Completion Rate:** 100% (all stories completed)
- **Test Coverage:** 75%
- **Code Quality:** High (all code reviewed)
- **Velocity Baseline:** 45 points established

## Process Improvements

### For Next Sprint
1. **Performance Review:** Add query optimization to Definition of Done
2. **Integration Testing:** Include integration tests in test coverage requirement
3. **Code Documentation:** Add docstring requirement to Definition of Done
4. **UI Review:** Include UI/UX review in code review process

### Long-term
1. **Performance Monitoring:** Set up performance tracking
2. **Automated Linting:** Add code quality checks to CI
3. **Security Audit:** Schedule security review
4. **User Testing:** Get feedback from actual users

## Technical Debt

### Identified Issues
1. **N+1 Query Problems:** Some views trigger multiple database queries
2. **Missing Indexes:** Frequently queried fields need database indexes
3. **Error Messages:** Some error messages are too technical for users
4. **Code Documentation:** Missing docstrings in some areas

### Planned Fixes
- Query optimization in Sprint 3
- Add indexes in next migration
- Improve error messages in Sprint 3
- Add documentation in code review process

## Team Feedback

### Positive
- "Great progress on core features - authentication and posting work well"
- "Feature-based organization really helped - minimal conflicts"
- "Testing framework is solid - caught several bugs early"
- "Team collaboration was smooth - good communication"

### Areas for Improvement
- "Some queries could be faster - need optimization"
- "UI could be more polished - functional but basic"
- "Would like more integration tests for complete flows"
- "Some error messages could be clearer"

## Retrospective Summary

**Overall:** Sprint 2 was highly successful. The team delivered all planned features, established a velocity baseline, and created a solid foundation for future development. The authentication and posting systems are working well, and the testing framework provides good coverage.

**Key Success:** Completing all 45 story points while maintaining code quality and test coverage.

**Main Focus for Sprint 3:** Build on this foundation with profile system, settings, and enhanced features like voting and search. Also focus on performance optimization and UI polish.
