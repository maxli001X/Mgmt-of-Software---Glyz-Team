# Sprint 4 Retrospective

## What Went Well
1. **Focus on Critical Path**: We prioritized the mandatory requirements (Deployment, A/B Test) and delivered them effectively.
2. **Analytics Implementation**: The self-rolled analytics solution was simple and effective, avoiding complex external dependencies.
3. **Deployment**: The deployment process on Render was smooth thanks to previous preparation.

## What Didn't Go Well
1. **Time Management**: We had to rush some of the documentation at the end.
2. **Testing**: While we have tests, we could have more comprehensive integration tests for the analytics flow.

## Improvements for Final Submission
1. **Polishing**: Focus on UI/UX polish in the final days.
2. **User Testing**: Get more users to test the production site to find edge cases.

## Action Items
- [ ] Conduct a full bug bash on the production site.
- [ ] Finalize the project report.
- [ ] Record the demo video.
