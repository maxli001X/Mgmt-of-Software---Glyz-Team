The sessions can feel slightly disorganized sometimes, as Alex tries to go through 100+ slides in 80 minutes. I do think Alex takes feedback really well and makes adjustments throughout the semester as he sees fit.

      "body": "Shane comes off as offputting at first but he grew on me and is one of the best profs I've had at SOM. The course is quant heavy so a firm understanding of the stuff covered in intro to stats and probability is essential. He covers material that's relevant for folks who think they might need to run surveys or other experiments in future roles in addition to the more qualitative stuff, e.g. around framing (think Nathan's portion of MMD), in a way that provides more colour and utility. The course is STEM eligible making it a great way to get STEM credits for international students. I 10/10 don't regret choosing it. Only caveat is that Shane is disoragnized (and proud of it) so be on his case about making sure he releases announcements as per the syllabus.",

      "body": "I really enjoyed linear programming in MMD and wanted to learn more. Overall though, it was very cursory and I didn't learn/do enough to start framing problems for linear programming. 2nd half taught us how to code in R, but I think prof should have stuck with Excel the whole way. Those who knew how to code found those lectures to be really slow, and those who didn't know how to code were confused. The quarter class is too short to be teaching people how to code; should focus more on actual LP skillset.",
