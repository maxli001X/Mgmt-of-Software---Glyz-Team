# Project Configuration

This folder contains Django project settings and configuration.

## Files
- `settings.py` - Main configuration (database, apps, security)
- `urls.py` - Master URL routing (traffic controller)
- `wsgi.py` - Production server entry point (used by Render/Gunicorn)
- `asgi.py` - Async server entry point (for future websockets)

## What is "treehole"?
This is your Django project name. Every Django project needs a configuration folder - ours is called "treehole" (the project name).

Think of it as: **Project Control Center**
